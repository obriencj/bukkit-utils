This is not a Bukkit plugin! Do not place this in the plugins folder for your server.

This project produced a jar which is a library to be loaded into the classpath when you
launch your server. It contains some utility classes that are depended upon by all of the
other Preoccupied bukkit plugins.

As an example of how to use this library, my setup keeps this, the rhino javascript lib,
and the craftbukkit server jar in a "lib/" directory. When I launch my server, I
construct a classpath from the files in the lib/ dir, and call the appropriate craftbukkit
class by name.

simplified example:

java \
  -classpath lib/bukkit-utils-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar:lib/craftbukkit-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar:lib/js.jar \
  org.bukkit.craftbukkit.Main \
  nogui
